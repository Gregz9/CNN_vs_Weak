# CNN_vs_Weak
This repo contains code and report related to project 3 in subject FYS-STK3155/FYS_STK4155 - Applied Dataanalysis and Machine Learning at University of Oslo. The main focus of this research is to compare strong and weak classifiers ability to classify images of pneumonia.

Assess dimention reduction methods combined with weak and strong learners for prediction of pneumonia. We will investigate PCA and Convolution for image dimentionality reduction (and DCT JPEG dimentionality reduction if we have time), combined with neural networks and random forests (and XGBoost if we have time).

## Instructions on retrieving data

We use Chest X-Ray images of from Mendeley Data. These can be downloaded [here](https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/files/f12eaf6d-6023-432f-acc9-80c9d7393433/file_downloaded). Once the zip file has been downloaded, place it in the data directory and unzip it.
